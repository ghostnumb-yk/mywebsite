# Profile Image Instructions

## To add your own profile image:
1. Place your profile photo in this directory
2. Name it "profile.jpg" (or update the HTML to match your filename)
3. The image will automatically be displayed in the round avatar on the home page

## Recommended image specifications:
- Size: 500x500 pixels (square aspect ratio works best)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Make sure your face is centered in the image for best display in the circular frame
